        <H2> Bugs & Issues</H2>
        At the time of writing there are no known bugs or issues. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I took the step of releasing a trial version for people to test and no issues were 
        found during that time.
        That said, it is impossible for me to test every variation of how over 350 unique commands 
        can interact with each other and I can't be certain how much testing other people have done.
        What I can say is that this product will be completely supported for the foreseeable future.

        <H2> Try the Debug Renderer</H2>
        If you have any issues be sure to look at the information on the debug renderer, this tool
        alone will probably solve most problems.

        <H2> Multithreading </H2>
        If Dark Dynamix is crashing on you then be sure to look at the information of multithreading to
        make sure you are doing everything in the correct order.

        <H2> Switching physics in an existing project</H2>
        If you are changing over to Dark Dynamix in a current project using another physics
        api then I would warn to be very cautious. During beta testing this was the main area were people
        had issues, most of the time it was not down to any fault with Dark Dynamix but just the fact that
        Dark Dynamix worked slightly differently to what the user expected due to being used to using a different api.
        In this situation I would advise you create a few independent projects, each one will test a different aspect
        of the physics in your game/app using Dark Dynamix. You will then be better placed to switch over to Dark Dynamix in your current
        project, remember to make a back-up copy before you change anything, just in case.

        <H2> Forum</H2>
        If none of the above helped then go to the TGC forums, Dark Dynamix has its own section where you 
        can get more information or ask for help.

        When posting about an issue be sure to replicate the issue in as little code as possible, this will
        help me identify and fix the problem, thanks.
