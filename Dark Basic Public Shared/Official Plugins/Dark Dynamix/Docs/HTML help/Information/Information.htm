     <h2>
     What is Dark Dynamix?
     </h2>
     Dark Dynamix is a set of easy to use commands that you can use alongside the Dark Basic commands
     to give your objects physical properties and make them behave in a realistic way. Dark Dynamix
     uses PhysX behind the scenes, this is a professional physics engine that is used in many 
     AAA games.

     <h2>
     How does it work?
     </h2> 
     It works by creating a physics simulation that runs behind the scenes, it works out where your objects
     should be at any one time and then updates your objects for you to give them realistic characteristics
     when it comes to collision and physics. This means that you need to tell the physics about your objects
     and how you want them to act and react once the simulation starts. We refer to the objects in the physics
     simulation as actors, you can see the actors in action by using the visual debugger or the debug
     renderer. Below are some examples of the common solutions for setting up different types of game objects.

     <h3>
     Terrain and level geometry
     </h3>  
     Certain objects in your game/application are going to be static, this means that they are not going 
     to move. Terrain and level geometry(buildings etc) are good examples of static objects, you can use triangle
     meshes for this type of object, once the commands are called your objects will be represented by static 
     actors in the simulation. They may not move but you will want other objects/actors to react to them in some way.
     A more lightweight and probably faster way to represent a terrain is with a Height Field.

     <h3>
     Characters     
     </h3>   
     Most games need characters of some sort, the most common way to represent a character is using a character
     controller. This will allow you to move your character around by moving the
     controller in the physics scene. Character controllers will automatically take care of all your characters
     collisions, you can also set the maximum height your character can step up and the angle it can climb up slopes.
     A character controller is a special case of a dynamic kinematic actor, dynamic means that it can move and
     kinematic means that it is not moved by applying forces, you move it yourself giving you direct control over
     the object.
     
     <h3>
     Boxes and balls
     </h3>
     If you have anything that resembles a box or a ball, you can use the 'make box' and 'make sphere'
     commands to set them up in your physics scene. You can set them up to be dynamic, meaning
     they will react to forces such as gravity or you can set them up as static actors which means they will
     not move but other objects will react to them. There are two types of dynamic actors, the default is 
     non-kinematic, if you set them to kinematic then they will not react to any forces but you can still move
     them around manually.


     <h3>
     Barrels, cylinders, eggs
     </h3>
     Obviously more complex shapes like these can easily be setup as static actors the same as terrain and
     level geometry above, but you may want these objects to be dynamic, you would then use an actor created from
     a convex mesh. The object should be a convex shape like a barrel, cylinder or egg but 
     you can usually use this command on objects that are not convex as the physics simulation will create
     a convex shape that resembles the object, although using compound actors may be a better solution in 
     these cases, see below. 

     <h3>
     Chairs, tables, tanks
     </h3>
     Again, complex shapes like these can easily be setup as static actors the same as terrain and
     level geometry above, but you may want these objects to be dynamic, you would then create a compound
     actor, this allows you to add one or more primitive and convex 
     shapes together into one actor. Note: if you want to actually drive a tank then you are probably
     best setting it up as a vehicle, see below.

     <h3>
     Cars, motorbikes, planes, tanks etc
     </h3>
     You can create a vehicle hull using a single shape or multiple shapes(compound, see above), you can
     then use fixed joints to add your wheels(wheel shapes) to the hull and you have a vehicle.

     This should be enough to get you started, there is lots more to learn though, you will find alot of 
     information in the documentation and examples, good luck.
