		DYN EMITTER GET RATE
		<span class="parameters">(int fluidID, int emitterIndex)
		</span>
		<br><br>This command will get the rate the particles are emitted. The 'rate' and the 'life' of the particles will determine if you have enough particles in your fluid to keep it emitting consistantly, if the emitter runs out of particles it will wait until more are available before emitting again. 
		<br><br>
		<span class="parameters">Parameters:
		</span>
		<br>fluidID - ID number of the fluid the given emitter belongs to.
		<br>emitterIndex - Index of the emitter, the index was returned when the emitter was created, if there is only one emitter for the given fluid then the index will be 0.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="returns">Returns:
		</span>
		<br>- Rate the particles are emitted.
