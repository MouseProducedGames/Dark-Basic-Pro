		DYN FLUID SET VISCOSITY
		<span class="parameters">(int fluidID, float value)
		</span>
		<br><br>Sets the viscosity value of the given fluid. Viscosity controls a fluid's thickness. For example, a fluid with a high viscosity will behave like treacle while a fluid with a low viscosity will be more runny like water. The viscosity member scales the viscosity force field which applies force to reduce the relative velocity of particles within the fluid. If a pair of particles are close together and have a high viscosity, then a strong force will be applied to reduce there relative velocity. If they are far apart and have a low viscosity value, then only a small force will be applied to reduce there relative motion. Reasonable values: 5-300
