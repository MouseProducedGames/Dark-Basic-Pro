		DYN FLUID MAKE EMITTER
		<span class="parameters">(int fluidID, float sizeX, float sizeY, float particleLife, int type, int posVec3ID, int rotVec3ID)
		</span>
		<br><br>Creates an emitter for the given fluid, emitters can share a single fluid although a fluid only has a maximum amount of particles available. An emitter becomes responsible for creating the particles, they are only destroyed if their life runs out or they come into contact with a drain. The emitter can only create particles as long as the fluid has particles available.  
		<br><br>
		<span class="parameters">Parameters:
		</span>
		<br>sizeX - Size of the emitter along its local x axis.
		<br>sizeY - Size of the emitter along its local y axis.
		<br>particleLife - Life of the particles.
		<br>type - The emitter can either create particles at a given rate or maintain a given pressure. Constant flow rate = 2, Pressure = 1
		<br>posVec3ID - ID number of the vector3 containing positional data.
		<br>rotVec3ID - ID number of the vector3 containing rotational data.
		<br>
		<br>

		<span class="returns">Returns:

		<br>Number of emitters belonging to the given fluid.
