		<span class="parameters">Parameters:
		</span>
		<br>softBodyID - ID number of the soft body.
		<br>attachmentFlag - Allows you to determine whether the relationship between soft body and the shape is one way or two way. Set as 0 for one way interaction, the object can pull the soft body, but the soft body cannot move the object. If the object moves then the soft body will follow it. However, if the soft body is pulled, the object will behave as if it is fixed and not move. Set to 1 for two way interaction.
