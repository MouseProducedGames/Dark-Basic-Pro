		<br><br>Cooks and then creates a cloth mesh, 'cooking' is just a term which means it is converting the mesh to a format PhysX can use for fast collision detection. You should try to avoid this function if possible and cook all your meshes to file and then when your game/app needs them there is no need for the slow cooking process, if you do need to cook meshes on the fly then be sure to check the return value and deal with both possible outcomes accordingly. 
		<br><br>
		<span class="parameters">Parameters:
		</span>
		<br>objectID - ID number of the object to create the mesh from.
		<br>clothMeshID - ID number you wish to assign to the cloth mesh, you use this ID number when creating an actor from this cloth mesh.
		<br>flags - Use this to enable features such as cloth tearing or hardware acceleration. NX_CLOTH_MESH_TEARABLE = 256, NX_MF_HARDWARE_MESH = 4

		<span class="returns">Returns:
