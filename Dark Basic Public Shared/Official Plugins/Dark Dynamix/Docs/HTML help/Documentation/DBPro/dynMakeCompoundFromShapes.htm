		DYN MAKE COMPOUND FROM SHAPES
		<span class="parameters">(int objectID, float density)
		</span>
		<br><br>Creates an actor using all the shapes held in an internal shape list which you add to using the 'dynMakeShape' commands. For example, if you have a model of a table which you desire to be dynamic you would create four leg objects and a surface object and match them to your model the best you can, you then create shapes using these temp objects, finally, create the compound actor assigning it to your table model.
		<br><br>
		<span class="parameters">Parameters:
		</span>
		<br>objectID - ID number of the object the compound actor will represent in the simulation.
		<br>density - Density value for the object.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<span class="returns">Returns:
		</span>
		<br>TRUE if successful, FALSE otherwise.
