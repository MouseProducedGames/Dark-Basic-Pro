		PHY SET JOINT TWIST LIMIT LOW
		<span class="parameters">(int jointDescID, float value, float spring, float damping, float restitution)
		</span>
		<br><br>This command is used to set a rotational low limit about the local x-axis. The twist limit is a little different than the swing limits, specified using a pair of angles(high,low) rather than just a single radius. This allows the limit orientations to be nonsymmetrical around the twist axis, unlike the swing axis.

		<span class="parameters">Parameters:
		</span>
		<br>jointDescID ID number of the descriptor.
		<br>value Angle beyond which the limit is active, angle expressed in degrees.
		<br>spring If greater than zero then the limit is soft, this means the spring will pull the joint back to the given limit.
		<br>damping If spring is greater than zero then this is the damping of the spring.
		<br>restitution Controls the amount of bounce when the joint hits a limit, a value of 0 causes the joint to stop dead, a value of 1.0 will cause the joint to bounce back with same velocity at which it hit the limit.
